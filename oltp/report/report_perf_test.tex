\section{Performance Tests}

In this section \textit{PostgreSQL}\cite{postgres}, \textit{Apache Spark}\cite{spark} and \textit{Apache Flink}\cite{flink} will be tested under OLAP workload. Results of our experiments should be comparable to other related works, therefore, \textit{TPC-H}\cite{tpcc} benchmark will be used to evaluate performance of mentioned technologies.

\subsubsection{Query Runtime}
Queries' runtime have been represented in Figure \ref{fig:pg_time}. Runtimes measured in seconds using \textit{Dstat}\cite{dstat}, a well developed resource statistics tool in Linux.

% \subsubsection{System Load}
% In \textit{*NIX} systems, \textit{system load} represents the number of tasks in the queue of CPU. Since in tremendous workloads, CPU utilization is likely to be close to 100\%, system load is more accurate metric.
