\section{Performance Tests}

In this section \textit{PostgreSQL}\cite{postgres} will be tested under OLAP workload. To achieve \textit{TPC-C}\cite{tpcc} benchmark standards, \textit{OLTPBench}\cite{oltpbench} will be used for PostgreSQL performance evaluation.

\subsubsection{Response Time}
Queries' runtime have been represented in Figure \ref{fig:pg_time}. Runtimes measured in seconds using \textit{Dstat}\cite{dstat}, a well developed resource statistics tool in Linux.

\subsubsection{System Load}
In \textit{*NIX} systems, \textit{system load} represents the number of tasks in the queue of CPU. Since in tremendous workloads, CPU utilization is likely to be close to 100\%, system load is more accurate metric.
